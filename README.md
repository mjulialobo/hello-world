# hello-world
For almost 3 years of my life I dedicated myself to communication and PR, but after 2 years working with technology companies as a PR, I decided to follow a new path and learn how to develop. 
Currently, I have dedicated myself to online courses and projects, and I am looking for a first job in the field as Junior.
Right now I am studying HTML5, CSS3, BootStrap 4, Java Script, ES6 (Modern JavaScript), PHP 7, Object Orientation, MySQL, PHP with PDO, Ajax, JQuery, MVC, APIs, IONIC, WordPress and others.
